## ✨ Key Features

This clone meticulously recreates the Apple premium web experience, focusing on complex layouts, typography, and fluid responsiveness.

* 📱 **Fully Responsive Layout:** Seamlessly transitions from a multi-column desktop view to a stacked mobile view using CSS Media Queries.
* 🔍 **Frosted Glass Navigation:** Features Apple's signature sticky navbar with a blur effect using CSS `backdrop-filter`.
* 🔲 **Advanced Grid & Flexbox:** Utilizes `display: grid` for the bottom "Bento Box" product layout and `display: flex` for precise alignment of heroes and navigation.
* 🖱️ **Interactive Animations:** * Subtle zoom effects (`transform: scale`) on product cards when hovered.
    * Animated Call-to-Action (CTA) arrows that shift naturally on interaction.
* 🚀 **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` for a premium navigational feel.
* 🖼️ **Smart Image Handling:** Uses `object-fit` and strategic background positioning to ensure product images never overlap text, regardless of screen size.
* 🌓 **Dynamic Theme Integration:** Incorporates both "Dark Mode" and "Light Mode" aesthetic sections, just like the real Apple site.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
* **CSS3:** Native CSS variables (`:root`), Grid, Flexbox, Transitions, and Pseudo-elements (`::after`, `:hover`).
* **Typography:** Implementation of Apple-style system fonts (`SF Pro Text`, `-apple-system`).
